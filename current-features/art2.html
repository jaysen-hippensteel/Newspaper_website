            As the 2021-2022 school year comes to an end, EAHS Expression asked a few knowledgeable seniors to grant some personal advice in response to a series of prompts. Answers were provided by an array of upcoming graduates, including early grads and those who chose to be a part of outside opportunities -- dual enrollment, career internship, and work experience.
            <p></p>
        <h3>What advice would you give to an incoming freshman?</h3>
        Don't wish high school away. Stay present in every moment: the good times and the hard times. It goes by so much faster than you think, and in the blink of an eye, you go from starting your first day of school to walking across that stage getting your diploma. Enjoy every second of freedom you have before you're forced to be an adult.” - Katie Wagner
        “Just be your authentic self and you will attract the energy you want in your life!” - Briahna Williammee
        <p></p>
        <h3>What do you think you’ll miss the most from your time in high school?</h3>
        “I will find that I will miss Pep Club. Being a part of a club that wants to bring more joy to the environment and school has been exciting. I have been able to make new friends, have a say in decisions, and be a part of a mural project that will help leave a mark on the school. To also have Mrs. Rohrer as a club advisor is amazing!” - Noelia Morales
        <p.</p>
        <h3>What is one part of high school you want to highlight as a part of your farewell (i.e. sports, art programs, music, etc.)?</h3>
        “[I would highlight] how well both our soccer team and basketball team did. Also, show out to as many sports [as] you can.” - Jakob Power
        “Winning the Lancaster-Lebanon league Section Two MVP in bowling.” - Ayden Pope
        <p></p>
        <h3>If you had the opportunity to redo high school, what would you do differently and why? </h3>
        “I would take the time to choose my friends based on who makes me feel valuable, but at the same time not base my self-image on other people. I would instead have more confidence in myself, and who God made me to be.” - Sophia Rajnic
        “I don’t think I would do anything differently. Everything happens for a reason, and if things didn’t happen the way they did, I wouldn’t be the same as I am now!” - Briahna Willimmee
        <p></p>
        <h3>If you participated in a career internship, work experience, or dual enrollment, what did you like most about it? Would you recommend it to other students? </h3>
        “Work experience gives you the time that you need to learn about the industry in the real world. I’d recommend it to those who are looking into any field that [would] need experience.” - Nicholas Halterman
        “I did dual enrollment and I loved it! It gives you the chance to manage your own time in preparation for college, and [it] gives you a sense of freedom.” - Sophia Rajnic
        “I had a teaching internship . . .  It really helped me [to] decide what I wanted to do in the future career-wise, so I would definitely recommend doing an internship to anyone who wants to explore potential career paths.” - Katie Wagner
